Chord Engine
============
	Chord is a hypertext narrative engine that links together myriad characters, places, items, ideas, and events.  The author creates any of these things in the database along with expositions.  The engine delivers pages for each and links them to other pages based on named content they contain.
	
Nouns
-----
	Characters, places, items, ideas, and events are all objects stored in the database.  These all treated similarly but have distinct properties.
	
Exposition
----------
	An exposition is essentially a story snippet.  The engine will automatically link to/from any noun which is defined in the database.

Pages
-----
	Each page is based on an exposition.  Some words (mostly nouns) are given as links to other pages.  In addition, links are provided to other expositions which are adjacent in time or location.  Words not defined in the database are simply shown as plain text rather than a link.
